Cardutils - a set of utilities for (credit) cards

I've copies the original that was abandoned and having issue at pip.
Includes functions to check, analyse and generate random
card numbers.

I probably don't need to tell you that the numbers generated
by this program are _NOT_ actually real card numbers, and
can't be used to buy stuff (dur).
